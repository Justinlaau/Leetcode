# Leetcode Challenge for 30days

# Dynamic programming
<h3>I am going to solve all hard level dynamic programming questions in Leetcode within two weeks and write down all the solution, thoughts about the questions.<h3>

# Day 1

- Longest Valid Parentheses (50mins solved)
- Count Palindromic Subsequences (100 mins solved)
- Number of Ways to Separate Numbers (8hrs solved)
- Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix (15 mins)
- Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays (2.5hrs solved) (OMG this question is so easy, i stucked at a little bug, fk me)
- Wildcard Matching (45mins) (forgot to initilize the dp array with edge cases)

```
Reflection

I watched a youtube video talks about blackbox method, do not focus on the detail 
first, make some assumptions, like if I can solve this subproblem what should 
I do next. I now can narrow down the compleixty of a problem. However, the 
speed is still under the bar, maybe I could improve by doing more and more questions.

-> Number of Ways to Separate Numbers is most difficult one, I have ever done. Many 
technics such as suffix array and prefix sum of the dp subproblem, are very useful 
and blew my mind.
